</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Requirements analysis</td>
    <td> To specify what services the proposed system will provide, to identify any conditions(time constraints, securtiy, and so on) on those services, and to define how the outside world will interact with the system</td>

    <td>Design</td>
    <td>Creates a plan for the construction of the proposed system</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>implementation</td>
    <td>Involves the actual writing of programs, creation of data files, and development of databases</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Testing</td>
    <td>Equated with the process of debugging programs and confirming that the final software product was compatible with the software requirments specifications</td>
</tr>
<tr>
